# This is a basic application made with html and pyscript

## Pyscipt can be downloaded and integrated from [pyscipt.net](`https://pyscript.net/`)

- it works similar to js
- define an event and use event listener to that event 
- pyscript provides document which can be imported from pyscipt
- we can use document to do DOM manupulation


## Overview of the Application
- takes in input 3 strings with respective ids
- by using their ids we could retrive the strings 
- the event is invoked via an event listener provided by pyscript called py-click 
- then the strings are manpulated and are submitted to the output div as we initally create and empty div with the id of "output"
